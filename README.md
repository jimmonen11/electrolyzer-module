# electrolyzer-module
1 MWe-DC Electrolyzer Module that uses oxygen ion conducting SOECs. Simulink file and accompanying MATLAB files. Feel free to use and cite:

To run simulations, first run the 'Electrolyzer_load.m' script to load all Simulink parameters into your workspace. You can then run the Simulink simulation file 'HTSE_electrolyzer_1MW_DC.slx'. The simulation is set up for steady state design conditions, but can be changed to examine dynamics of the electrolyzer module. All other files need to be in the same folder to run.
